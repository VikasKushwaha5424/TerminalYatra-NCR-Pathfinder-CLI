How It Works: The Core Concepts
This project isn't just a list of stations; it's a smart model of the entire Delhi Metro network. Here‚Äôs a simple breakdown of the ideas that power it.

1. Modeling the Metro as a Graph üß©
At its heart, this project treats the entire Delhi Metro like a giant connect-the-dots puzzle. This is a concept from a field of computer science called graph theory.
Stations become the dots (called nodes).
Tracks between stations become the lines connecting the dots (called edges).
The distance (in km) is the "length" of each line (called edge weight).
By representing the network this way, we can use powerful algorithms to analyze it and find the best routes.

2. Finding the Shortest Path (by Distance) üó∫Ô∏è
This feature is like asking a GPS for the quickest driving route.
Algorithm: It uses the classic and highly efficient Dijkstra's algorithm.
Goal: To find the path that covers the fewest kilometers from your start to your destination. The app looks at the "length" of every track segment and calculates the route that minimizes the total distance traveled.

3. Finding the Easiest Path (Minimum Interchanges) üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Sometimes the shortest path has too many line changes. This clever feature answers the question: "How can I get there with the fewest interruptions?"
Concept: To solve this, the algorithm plays a "game" on a special, imaginary version of the map where changing lines is very "expensive."
How it works:
Traveling between stations on the same line costs just 1 point.
Changing lines at an interchange station costs a huge 100 points.
By finding the path with the lowest total score, the algorithm naturally discovers the route that avoids the expensive 100-point penalties, giving you the path with the minimum number of interchanges.

4. Drawing the Map: Connections, Not Geography üé®
You might notice that a straight line (like the Red Line) appears curved on the generated map. This is intentional! The map's goal is to show the network's structure, not its real-world geography.
The map drawing algorithm (kamada_kawai_layout) acts like a physics simulation:
Springs: Each metro line is like a spring, trying to pull its connected stations together.
Magnets: Interchange stations (like Kashmere Gate or Rajiv Chowk) act like powerful magnets, pulling multiple lines toward a central point.

This is why a straight line gets bent‚Äîthe algorithm pulls it towards the interchanges it connects to. It prioritizes showing the network's overall connectivity over perfect geographical shapes. This gives a much clearer, schematic view of how the entire system links together.

The Data Source: delhi_metro_edges.csv üìÇ
The entire project is powered by a single, simple CSV file. This file acts as the blueprint for the metro network, defining every connection in a straightforward way.

Structure
Each row in the CSV represents a single track segment between two adjacent stations and has three columns: station_u,station_v,distance_km
station_u: The first station in the connection.
station_v: The second station in the connection.
distance_km: The distance between them in kilometers.

The program reads this "edge list" line by line to build the complete graph model in memory.

The Naming Convention
You'll notice a specific naming pattern for the stations, which is crucial for the program to understand the network's structure automatically.
Regular Stations: station-name_line-color (e.g., saket_yellow) This tells the program two things: the station's simple name is "Saket" and it is on the "Yellow" line. The code parses this by splitting the string at the _.
Interchange Stations: station-name_(interchange line1 line2 ...) (e.g., rajiv chowk_(interchange yellow blue)) This format signals that the station is an interchange. The program uses this information to identify the multiple lines that pass through it, which is essential for both pathfinding algorithms and for drawing the map with the correct connections.
This self-contained naming scheme is very efficient, as it allows all necessary line and interchange information to be stored directly in the station's name, eliminating the need for extra data files.
