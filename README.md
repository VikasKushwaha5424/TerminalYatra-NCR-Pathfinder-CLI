🚇 TerminalYatra: Delhi Metro Pathfinder
A Python CLI for the Delhi Metro network. Find optimal routes by distance or interchanges, calculate fares, and visualize the entire network or a specific journey.

✨ Features
Dual Pathfinding:

Shortest Path (km): Finds the route with the absolute minimum distance using Dijkstra's.

Easiest Path (Interchanges): Finds the route with the fewest line changes.

Dynamic Visualization:

Full Network Map: Generates and saves a high-resolution, color-coded PNG of the entire network.

Journey Highlight: Instantly displays a pop-up map highlighting your last-calculated path on a faded-out background.

Practical Info:

Fare Calculation: Automatically calculates the fare based on your route's distance.

Step-by-Step Directions: Provides clear text directions for your trip.

Polished CLI:

Rich Interface: A clean, colorful, and user-friendly UI powered by Rich and Colorama.

Flexible Input: Select stations by their full name or their index number from a list.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: The core programming language.

NetworkX: For all graph modeling, manipulation, and pathfinding algorithms.

Matplotlib: For generating both the static network map and the dynamic journey plots.

Rich & Colorama: For creating the beautified command-line interface.

🧠 How It Works: The Dual-Graph Model
This project uses two different graph models to answer two different questions.

1. Shortest Path (by Distance)
This is a simple, weighted graph:

Nodes: station_name

Edges: A track connecting two stations.

Weight: The distance in km (e.g., 2.1).

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the path with the minimum sum of weights.

2. Easiest Path (by Interchanges)
This is a more complex graph built to "trick" Dijkstra's into finding the path with the fewest changes:

Nodes: (station_name, line_color)

Travel Edge: ('Saket', 'yellow') to ('Malviya Nagar', 'yellow'). Cost = 1.

Interchange Edge: ('Kashmere Gate', 'red') to ('Kashmere Gate', 'yellow'). Cost = 100 (the INTERCHANGE_PENALTY).

By finding the path with the lowest total "cost," the algorithm naturally avoids the 100-point penalty, giving you the path with the minimum number of interchanges.

📂 The Data: delhi_metro_edges.csv
The entire network is built from a single CSV file. The program's accuracy depends entirely on the naming convention in this file:

Regular Station: saket_yellow

Interchange Station: rajiv chowk_(interchange yellow blue)

The code parses these names to automatically build the graphs.
