# TerminalYatra-NCR-Pathfinder-CLI
A Python CLI for the Delhi Metro network. üöá Find the shortest route by distance or the most convenient path with the fewest interchanges using Dijkstra's algorithm. Provides clear directions, calculates fares, and generates a full, color-coded network map with networkx and matplotlib.


#‚ú® Features
Dual Pathfinding Algorithms:

‚Ä¢	Find the shortest path based on geographical distance.

‚Ä¢	Find the most convenient path with the minimum number of interchanges.

‚Ä¢	Detailed Travel Directions: Get clear, step-by-step instructions for your journey, including line changes.

‚Ä¢	Fare Calculation: Automatically calculates the fare for the generated route based on the total distance.

‚Ä¢	Interactive Station Selection: View a numbered list of all stations and select them by name or number.
